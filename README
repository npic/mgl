My Game Library


A short description (use -h or --help to see usage):

* add-game.pl: add a game to the database
* del-game.pl: delete a game from the database
* edit-game.pl: edit a game in the database
* gen-desktop.pl: generate a .desktop-file for menu
* import-desura.pl: import all the games from your Desura installation
* lookup-game.pl: search for a game with regexps in the database
* mgl.pl: core program (interactive)
* mgl-x.pl: wrapper that starts mgl.pl in a separate X server
* sort-db.pl: sort games alphabetically in the database


Notes:

* gen-desktop.pl will generate .desktop-file that starts mgl-x.pl
* mgl-x.pl starts Urxvt terminal as X client. It is hardcoded at the moment, sorry.
* mgl-x.pl starts "nvidia-settings -l" after X server starts. It is hardcoded too, but you can disable it by commenting out appropriate line.
